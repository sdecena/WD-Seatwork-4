## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->

The project involves creating a website that showcases two distinct feature display designs using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of different design approaches in presenting content. The key components include two separate sections on the website, each implementing a unique layout and style for displaying features. HTML is used to structure the content and define the elements, while CSS is used to style the elements, providing different visual aesthetics and user experiences for each design.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
WD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
|   └─ js
